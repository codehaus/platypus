# Individual commands that the Platypus parser recognizes.
# Families of commands are loaded separately and are not in this file.
#
#Syntax is command root = type, followed by y/n allowed in code.
# So  [+i]=0n      --> root: [+i]; 0 = no parameters; n = not allowed in code
# type can be:  0 = takes no commands
#               v = takes a value
#               s = takes a string
#               m = takes a matched string (so [@ followed by @], for example)
#               r = replace (the root is an alias for a command in a family) followed by new root.
